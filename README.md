## Kargo Tracking System

This is a simple Kargo Tracking System Java application. The application allows the user to enter cargo information, list the cargos, search for a specific cargo, and delete cargos.

## Folder Structure

The Kargo Tracking System application is created in Java using the Swing library. The application provides a user interface to perform the following basic operations:

Add Cargo: The user can add a new cargo by providing cargo tracking number, name, address, departure city, and destination city. The cargo status is automatically set randomly to "In Transit", "Delivered", or "Out for Delivery" after adding the cargo.

Search Cargo: The user can search for a cargo by entering the cargo tracking number. If the cargo is found, its name and address are displayed.

Show Cargos: The user can view a list of all added cargos. The displayed information includes cargo tracking number, name, address, departure city, destination city, and status.

Delete Cargo: The user can delete a cargo by selecting it from the list. The selected cargo is removed from both the list and the underlying data structure.

## Getting Started
To start the application, run the main method in the Main class. This will open a window using the Swing user interface. In the window, you can enter cargo information, list the cargos, search for cargos, and delete them.
## Development
The application is developed in Java and uses the Swing library for the user interface. You can use your IDE to further develop or customize the code and the user interface.
